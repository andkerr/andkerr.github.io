            <h4>Who are you, and where are you from?</h4>
            <p>
                My name is Andrew Graham Hynd Kerr. I am a descendent of the Hynd
                and Kerr families which have their roots in Scotland (clan Kerr),
                England, and Ireland (I'm not sure where else before there yet).
                I grew up in the west end of Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
                and have spent most of my life so far in the Golden Horseshoe
                region, which surrounds the western end of Lake Ontario.
            </p>
            <h4>What are your career and life plans?</h4>
            <p>
                I am in my fourth year of undergrad at University of Michigan,
                where study Physics, Percussion Performance, and Computer Science.
                I will graduate in Spring 2023, at which point I plan to either
                begin working in private industry or return to graduate school
                for a master's program in physics, math, or computer science. I
                am interested in quantum computing and building software tools
                that are useful for data analysis or scientific research. I am
                aiming for jobs in similar areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not yet sure where I want to settle. I enjoy four seasons,
                and am not shy of winter. I have something of a bias toward
                Canada, and expect that my work will require me to live in
                proximity to a large city. That said, the advent of widespread
                remote work seems to be creating previously unimaginable options
                for working-living configurations, and I have long had a dream
                of having a home in a rurual area with plenty of trees around
                that I could cut down for firewood.
