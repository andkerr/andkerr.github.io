            <h4>Typing and Sight Reading</h4>
            <p>Andrew Kerr - December 29, 2021</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
            I was working on a typing practise exercise the other day, and
            noticed some similarities between typing fast and sight reading
            sheet music.
            </p>
            <p>
            Both activities, done well, require the participant to look well
            ahead with their eyes to process incoming information as their
            hands take care of the musical notes or words that are presently
            being played or typed. This requires a kind of uncoupling hands
            and eyes, the result of which sometimes feels like a widening of my
            field of vision in order to percieve larger pieces of musical or
            textual information. When I am sight reading or typing my most
            effectively, I have the feeling that I am almost watching myself
            type or play as I am scanning the page, my primary focus.
            </p>
            <p>
            To that end, I am curious whether practise in either typing or
            sight reading can affect one's performance in the other. A useful
            sight reading exercise that facilitates the eyes and hands moving
            independently, is to look ahead to the next note on the staff and
            say its name as you play the previous note, continuing through an
            entire passage in this way so that you are always looking and
            one note in front of yourself. As this becomes more comfortable,
            widening the gap between the played and spoken notes adds
            additional challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
            As an experiment, I tried the same exercise with the typing
            practise I activity, and was surprised to find that it felt much
            the same as it did as a sight reading exercise. With pracitse, I
            have noticed a marked increase in my words-per-minute and
            accuracy as a result of becoming comfortable with looking a few
            words ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am looking forward to further exploring the connection between
            typing and sight reading.
