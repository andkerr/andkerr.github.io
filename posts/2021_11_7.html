                Before talking about the difference between public and private
                ADT members, it's helpful to understand the distinction
                between and ADT's implementation details and interface.
                A common situation when creating a custom ADT is having some
                properties that you don't want to be directly accessible from
                outside of the ADT, and some that are explicitly meant for
                "outside use".
            </p>
            <p>
                The doubly-linked list that we created in Project
                4 is a great example: the List class included methods that allow
                for other parts of a program to perform certain actions on a
                List instance, like inserting and removing elements, or
                getting a list's size. These methods made up the List's
                interface. On the other hand, someone can use the List interface
                without knowing a thing about nodes. The fact that a linked
                list is a collections of nodes connected by their pointers is
                a true implementation detail of a linked list.
            </p>
            <p>
                The separation between implementation details and interface
                creates a need for separate 'public' and 'private' member
                declaration sections in an ADT. If we want something to only be
                accesible in the ADT's namespace, we declare it as private. If
                it meant to be accessbile elsewhere, it is declared as public.
            </p>
            <p>
                // actually put the linked list example here...
            </p>
            <p>
                // "properties" of private members
                // example about private member access
            </p>
