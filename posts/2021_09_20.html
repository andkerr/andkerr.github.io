            <h4>Derivatives and the Present</h4>
            <p>Andrew Kerr - September 20, 2021</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Recently I was asked what I would talk about if I had
                to give a TEDTalk. Here's what I said:
            </p>
            <p>
                "It would probably be something about how the concepts
                of a derivative and the present are related.
                In mathematics, derivatives describe the instantaneous
                rate of change of a quantity. This is an incredibly
                paradoxical concept. Rate of change usually refers to
                variation over a finite time interval, so what does it
                mean to say that something is changing at a certain
                rate at a particular instant?
            </p>
            <p>
                Talking about the present introduces a similar paradox.
                “Now” is a point in time that has no length. Imagine
                looking at your watch to tell someone the exact time:
                by the time you finish saying “it’s —“, a few seconds
                has passed. Your watch time doesn’t match up with what
                you said anymore. In order for the concept of the
                present to make sense, it must be stretched to include
                the few seconds of the past that live in your short
                term memory."
            </p>
            <p>
                I owe most of the ideas about derivatives to my
                university Calculus curriculum, and about the present
                to Candace Brower's
                <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/745907?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">
                    article</a>, which refers to William James' 1890
                <i>Principles of  Psychology</i>.
